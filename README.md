# Project 02: SimPlot++ Similarity Analysis

**Description:**
Simulates a simplified SimPlot++ analysis by computing sequence similarity between a query and reference sequence using a sliding window approach.

**How it works:**
- Reads two DNA sequences (query and reference).
- Compares them using a sliding window to calculate percent identity.
- Plots the similarity curve using matplotlib.

**Files:**
- `query.fasta`: Query sequence.
- `reference.fasta`: Reference sequence.
- `02_simplot_similarity.py`: Python script to calculate and plot similarities.

**Requirements:**
- Python
- Biopython
- matplotlib

**Note:** Example FASTA files must be supplied by the user.
