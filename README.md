## ðŸš€ Project Description

This project integrates **3D Deep Learning segmentation** and **Monte Carlo radiation simulations** to predict the **tumor response to radiotherapy in glioma patients**. Inspired by datasets and protocols from the Mount Sinai Health System, it aims to support **personalized treatment optimization** in clinical settings.

---

##  Components

- 3D U-Net for brain tumor segmentation 
- DenseNet for tumor response classification 
- Geant4-based voxelized Monte Carlo simulation 
- Dose-response analysis with radiobiological modeling 
- Interactive dashboard for visualization and decision support

## Repository Structure

See directory tree above.

---

##  Dataset

Initially uses the [MSD Task01_BrainTumour](https://www.medicaldecathlon.com/) dataset. Can be extended with Mount Sinai or TCGA-GBM datasets.

---

##  Requirements

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

---

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by the clinical research framework of the **Mount Sinai Health System** and supported by previous collaborations with **IBM** and **CERN** practices.
